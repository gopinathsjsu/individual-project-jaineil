### About the Design Patterns used:

I have used two design patterns as follows:

- Singleton (Creational Design Pattern) 
  - All the major app methods are invoked in Main class as methods. We make Main class a Singleton.
- Factory (Creational Design Pattern) 
  - Used this pattern to hide the output generator logic from the client (in our case, the Billing class)
